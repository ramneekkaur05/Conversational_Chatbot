## 🚀 Features

- **Google Gemini API Integration** – Uses Google's latest **Gemini 2.5 Flash** model.
- **Real-Time Streaming Responses** – Displays answers word-by-word, like modern AI chat apps.
- **Conversation Memory** – Maintains chat history during the session.
- **Minimal, Modern UI** – Built with Streamlit for easy customization.

## How It Works
- The chatbot uses Google’s Gemini API (`gemini-2.5-flash`) for fast and intelligent responses.
- Chat history is stored in `st.session_state` so it remains available throughout the session.
- Responses are generated in a streaming fashion for better engagement.

## Uses
This chatbot can be used in multiple contexts:
- **Education** — Helping students with explanations, summaries, or tutoring.
- **Healthcare** — Guiding patients with general health-related queries (non-medical advice).
- **Entertainment** — Storytelling, games, and interactive fun.
- **Language Learning** — Practicing conversations in different languages.
- **Translation** - Can be used for translating text
- **Coding** - Generate or understand the code
